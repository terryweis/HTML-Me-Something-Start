      <h2 id = "altHeader">What is Dungeons and Dragons?</h2>
      <p>Dungeons and Dragons (commonly referred to as DnD) is a Table Top Role Playing Game (TTRPG), which is a game in which several people take on different roles within a game and roleplay. It is akin to acting, but you do not have to be an actor to play. 
         I have been playing Dungeons and Dragons or other TTRPGs for over a decade. In that time I have had the opportunity to play (and run) some pretty incredible modules.
         What is a module you may ask? This is story that the players of the TTRPG to play though and normally includes encounters. Encounters can be broken down into a few a different catagories. Some may be encounters where
         the players may have to fight thier way through (many encounters fall under this category), or perhaps think their way through, such as a trap or puzzle. Some encounters are simply a conversation so the player can learn valuable bits of information. 
         Having memorable moments within encounters is what seperates good modules to great modules. </p>
      <p><em>** A brief clarification** Memorable moments can be made in any module because of silly situations that pop up, wonderful roleplaying, or an amazing roll of the dice that change the course of an encounter at a key moment.
         My list is based off the writing and concepts within them that provide space for these moments to happen.</em></p>
         <h2 id = "altHeader">Seekers of the Ashen Crown</h2>
         <div><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0440284957_65" alt="" class = "sizing">
         </div>
         <p>Seekers of the Ashen Crown has the players looking through a ruined area in search of a path to a fallen spire. The spire was known to be home to an oracle that is able to give an answer to one question if asked. 
            The party (group of player) will travel through goblin and kobalds hoards as well as other people who are looking to find the path as well. They are able to befriend or make new enemies as the travel from location to location.
            After finding the path to the spire, each member of the group will be able to ask Oracle one question about themsleves or the future.

         <h2 id ="altHeader">Whispers of the Vampire Blade</h2>
         <div><img src="https://www.yumpu.com/en/image/facebook/19832081.jpg" alt="" class="sizing">
         </div>
         <p>In Whispers of the Vampire Blade, the setting is in Eberron. Eberron is a futuristic setting with a grab bag of interesting aspects. Do you like dinosaurs? How about trains? How about a whole race of people that were once nothing more than automatons and gained sientence?
            Eberron has something for everyone.In In this module the party is charged with delivering a package to a collector, and instructed to not open the package. They board the Lightening rail (a train powered by lightening) and set out for their destination. Along the way, the train is held up in a classic
            Old West style hiest. Once the package is taken from the group, the party must set out to find out who took thier delivery, what it is, and why other people are trying to steal it. This is a heist style story mixed with a lot of intrigue and a memorable story.</p>
         <h2 id = "altHeader" >Curse of Strahd</h2>
         <div><img src="https://i0.wp.com/shaneplays.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dd-curse-of-strahd-front-cover.png?fit=624%2C816&ssl=1" alt="" class = "sizing"></div>
         <p>One of the most famous (or infamous) modules, this story is fantastic and really stood the test of time. Created in the 1980's, this module has had many iterations through the different versions of Dnd. The group is wisked away into a different plane of existance known as the Dread Realm. The ruler of this area is a mythic creature known as Strahd Von Zarrovich.
            There are many rumors surrounding this character, some maybe true and some are outright lies. Its up to the players to find out which is which while traversing the dreaded landscape. This module ranks as one of my most favorite because the theme is very gothic, gives amazing encounters, and  has plot twists as the story progresses. The overall gameplay is extremly customizable, and
            leaves players wanting to keep playing until they are able to make it back home (if they can).

         <p id="testP" class = "funParagraph">In the end, be sure to read up on any module you are looking at investing time into and remember even a lackluster module can be great with a few modifications or a (un)lucky roll of the dice. As long as the players are willing to roleplay, use their imagination and really enjoy their time at the table, you can make memeorable moments in your game. And as always... </p>
